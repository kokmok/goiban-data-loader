Providing new data
-------

Data files provided by some european bank institutes (e.g Austria and Germany) is sometimes provided as a ISO-8859-1 encoded file.
It should be converted to UTF-8 before being committed to the repository.

This is possible using `iconv`.

```bash
# Austria
$ iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf8 at_original.csv > at.csv
# Germany
$ iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf8 bundesbank_original.txt > bundesbank.txt
```

Running
-------

You should load the data into a database called 'goiban'.

```bash
$ go run loader.go bundesbank "mysql_user:password@tcp(localhost)/goiban?charset=utf8"
```

or to load all data

```bash
$ DATABASE_URL="mysql_user:password@tcp(localhost)/goiban?charset=utf8" make load
```
